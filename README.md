 # Pypto.bot
 A cripto-bot idea by @tuicher
 
 ### Purpose 
 Test and learn some things about Binance API, Crypto, and Trading. feel free to collaborate to the project.

 ### The Idea
 The goal is to create a full configurable Bot that uses a connection to the Binance API to determinate on what state the market is.
 
 ## 1St Phase
 The very first program will be focused on be capable to make decisions based on some prerecorded secuence of data, that whould be catched at the same resolution.
 
 The actual experimentation data says that its recomendable to use a 2 request/seg resolution. This is caused because we can process the data rapidly, this data flow depens on the offers on the Binance Trademarket which is on 'human scale'.
